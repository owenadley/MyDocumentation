[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/odocs/badge/?version=latest)](https://odocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

Documentation hosted through ReadTheDocs, written in RST and generated by Sphinx Python Documentation Generator.

This documentation is a growing repository of various bits and pieces of information for various languages, frameworks and concepts that I have encountered and feel I may want to reference it again. 

Also helps me to memorize it by self documenting!
