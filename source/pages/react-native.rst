Built-in Components
====================
FlatList
---------
FlatList offers a list component for RN that is scrollable and refreshable on pull.
The main advantage of a FlatList is that it lazy loads its data which can be great for large data sets.
Items that are scrolled passed are also removed to save memory and processing time.
